Step 1: Creating the project folder
    Open your Terminal and make your project folder.
    mkdir phalcon_sample && cd phalcon_sample

    OR 

    Add Folders manually

Step 2: Configuring Docker
        The Dockerfile is required by Docker to make a docker container with the Phalcon image.
        Make a file named docker-compose.yml with the source code bellow.

        Change Phalcon version if prompted (PHALCON_VERSION=4.0.5)

Step 3: Running the Docker container
        Execute this command to start the Docker container.
        docker-compose up -d

        If adding PHP myadmin use docker-compose build before docker-compose up

Step 4: Creating the Phalcon application
        We will use the Phalcon developer tools to create a default Phalcon project. Run this command to initialize a composer application.
        docker-compose exec app composer init

         Welcome to the Composer config generator  
                                            


                                        This command will guide you through creating your composer.json config.

                                        Package name (<vendor>/<name>) [root/html]: phalcon/app
                                        Description []: Phalcon application
                                        Author [, n to skip]: n
                                        Minimum Stability []: 
                                        Package Type (e.g. library, project, metapackage, composer-plugin) []: 
                                        License []: 

                                        Define your dependencies.

                                        Would you like to define your dependencies (require) interactively [yes]? no
                                        Would you like to define your dev dependencies (require-dev) interactively [yes]? bo
                                        Please answer yes, y, no, or n.
                                        Would you like to define your dev dependencies (require-dev) interactively [yes]? no
                                        Add PSR-4 autoload mapping? Maps namespace "Phalcon\App" to the entered relative path. [src/, n to skip]: 

                                        {
                                        "name": "phalcon/app",
                                        "description": "Phalcon application",
                                        "autoload": {
                                                "psr-4": {
                                                "Phalcon\\App\\": "src/"
                                                }
                                        },
                                        "require": {}
                                        }

                                        Do you confirm generation [yes]? 
                                        Generating autoload files
                                        Generated autoload files
                                        PSR-4 autoloading configured. Use "namespace Phalcon\App;" in src/
                                        Include the Composer autoloader with: require 'vendor/autoload.php';




        After the composer.json is created, you should install the Phalcon developer tools and create the application.
        
        1. docker-compose exec app composer require --dev phalcon/devtools

        2. docker-compose exec app ./vendor/bin/phalcon project application simple


Step 5: Accessing the application
        IF you concluded the last steps without errors, you can access your project by your browser, the project is running in http://localhost:8080
